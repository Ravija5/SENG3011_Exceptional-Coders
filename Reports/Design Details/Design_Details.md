**1. Describe how you intend to develop the API module and provide the ability to run it in Web service mode**

Firebase

**2. Discuss your current thinking about how parameters can be passed to your module and how results are collected. Show an example of a possible interaction. (e.g.- sample HTTP calls with URL and parameters)**

Parameters can be passed to the module by using *query paramters*. Query paramaters can be used to define the mode that the API is running in, and also allow for the collection of results. For example the module could accept a URL in the following form:`[hostname]?start_time=1582548876end_time=1589548213`

**3. Present and justify implementation language, development and deployment environment (e.g. Linux, Windows) and specific libraries that you plan to use.**
