## Software Tools & Team member responsibilities
**TeamGantt** is used as a project management tool to develop a GANTT chart. This allows us to break the project down into tasks, assign tasks to individuals, set deadlines for tasks and track dependencies between tasks.

**Trello** is a kanban style, list oriented management tool. This allows us to visualise the progress of the project generally, and allows us to effectively distribute tasks, and monitor progress.
